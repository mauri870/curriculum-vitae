### CV

Hi, this is my cv. You can build a pdf running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install texlive-xetex
make
```

On Arch I prefer to use tectonic:
```
yaourt -S tectonic
make tectonic
```

You can also view the resulting pdf on my [website](https://mauri870.github.io)

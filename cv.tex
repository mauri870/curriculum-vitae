                    \textbf{\textit{Remote / Full-time}}
                    \newline
		    Following a Senior Software Engineer role I was offered the position of CTO to which I currently hold. Our main product is a SaaS platform focused on predictive dialers and Call Center automation. In this new position I have a more operational role, coordination of the development team as the Scrum Master, enforcing of Agile methodologies based on OKRs at the company level and DevOps / CICD operations. I still participate closely in every stage of the development process and still develop new services as needed, software engineering is indeed my passion!
		    
		    In the year of 2020 3CPlus reached an MRR growth of 120\% with more than a thousand concurrent users.

    2016-2019   &   \worktitle{Software engineer}{3CPLUS Call Center Solutions}
		    		\textbf{\textit{Remote / Full-time}}
		    		\newline
		    Working from the start of a SaaS platform focused on predictive dialers and Call Center automation, participating in virtually all architecture decisions and choices of technologies.
		    
		    \textit{Backend Engineer}: developed applications and REST / GRPC / Websocket APIs in Go, NodeJS and PHP. Also Asterisk PABX applications written in C / Rust. Documentation with Swagger/PlantUML.
		    
		    \textit{Frontend Engineer}: development of SPAs in VueJS, Vuex, including a custom webphone with support for web extension, PWA/Cordova app and webapp reusing the same codebase.
		    
		    \textit{AI}: I applied CNNs on the detection of mailboxes with Tensorflow, this greatly improved the performance and assertivity of our predictive dialer.
		    
		    \textit{Software Arquitecture}: I worked in the planning, development and deployment of microservices alongside the integration with cloud based solutions.
		    
		    \textit{DevOps}: transition to Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes clusters, which is current the backbone of our scalable infraestructure (including telephony). The CI/CD is done with Gitlab and every process from testing to deployment is automated.
		    
		    As you can see, more responsabilities arose with time and I'm not just a software engineer anymore so a new position of CTO was offered to me, which I promptly accepted with great care.
